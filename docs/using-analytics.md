# Using Analytics

This guide explains how to use the analytics features in the Ad Portal to track and analyze ad performance.

## Accessing Analytics

### For Advertisers

1. Log in to your Ad Portal account
2. From the dashboard, locate the ad you want to analyze
3. Click the "View Stats" button on the ad card

### For Developers

1. Log in with a developer account
2. From the dashboard, click the "View All Stats" button to see system-wide analytics
3. You can also view individual ad statistics by clicking "View Stats" on any ad card

## Individual Ad Analytics

The ad statistics page provides detailed performance metrics for a single ad:

### Key Metrics Overview

At the top of the page, you'll see four key metric cards showing:
- **Views**: Total number of times the ad was viewed
- **Clicks**: Total number of users who clicked on the ad
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Percentage of views that resulted in clicks
- **Average Watch Duration**: Average time users spent watching the ad in seconds

### Performance Charts

The page displays visual representations of your ad's performance:
- **Event Counts**: Bar charts showing views, clicks, and skips
- **Performance Rates**: Bar charts showing CTR and conversion rate

### Date Filtering

To analyze performance over specific time periods:

1. Select a date range using the "From" and "To" date pickers
2. Click "Show graph" to display a time series chart
3. The chart will show daily performance for views, clicks, and skips over your selected period

### Reading the Time Series Chart

The time series chart provides several insights:
- **Trend Lines**: See how performance metrics change over time
- **Data Points**: Hover over any point to see the exact values for that day
- **Comparison**: Compare different metrics (views vs. clicks) to identify patterns

## System-Wide Analytics (Developers Only)

If you have developer access, you can view system-wide analytics:

### Overall Performance

The page shows aggregated metrics across all ads in the system:
- Total views, clicks, and skips
- Average CTR
- Average watch duration

### Per-Advertiser Breakdown

System-wide analytics are broken down by advertiser:
- Each advertiser's total performance metrics
- Individual ad performance within each advertiser section

### Daily Performance Trends

The time series chart for system-wide analytics shows:
- Daily performance across the entire system
- Trends that may not be visible when looking at individual ads
- Patterns in usage that can inform system optimization

## Interpreting Analytics Data

### Key Performance Indicators

- **High CTR (>5%)**: Indicates effective ad content that resonates with users
- **Low Skip Rate**: Suggests the ad is relevant and engaging
- **Long Watch Duration**: Shows users are engaged with the video content
- **Low CTR (<1%)**: May indicate issues with ad content or targeting

### Using Analytics to Improve Ads

1. **Identify Trends**: Look for patterns in performance over time
2. **Compare Metrics**: Analyze how different metrics relate to each other
3. **Test and Iterate**: Use insights to improve ad content and settings

### Best Practices for Analysis

- Check analytics regularly (weekly or monthly)
- Compare performance across different ads
- Look for correlations between ad properties and performance
- Use date filtering to isolate the impact of changes

## Exporting Analytics Data

Currently, the Ad Portal does not support exporting analytics data. To capture data:
1. Use browser screenshot functionality
2. Record key metrics manually

## Getting the Most Out of Analytics

- Set clear goals for what you want to achieve with your ads
- Focus on metrics that align with your goals
- Look for trends rather than single-day fluctuations
- Use the date filtering to analyze seasonal patterns or specific campaigns
