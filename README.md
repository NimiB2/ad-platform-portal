## Overview
**Ad Portal** is a React-based web dashboard that allows advertisers to manage ad campaigns and developers to monitor ad performance across the AdSDK ecosystem. It provides an intuitive interface for uploading ads, viewing statistics, and analyzing campaign effectiveness.

The portal serves as the management frontend for the Flask Ad Server backend and complements the Android SDK integration.
